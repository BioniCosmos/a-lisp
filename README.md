# A-Lisp

another Lisp interpreter in C

Status: WIP, Unable to compile due to duplicate symbols caused by misuse of macros

---

I spend months learning and practising how to write a Lisp Interpreter with C following a nice tutorial [*Build Your Own Lisp*](https://buildyourownlisp.com/). At the moment, however, I must say that I’m done with C, a **nightmare**! Honestly, I don’t know whether I will stick to it, but I will upload the source code in due course.

Update: I have given up.
